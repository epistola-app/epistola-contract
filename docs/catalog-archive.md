# Portable Catalog Archive

`CatalogArchiveReader` and `CatalogArchiveWriter` define the portable ZIP
transport for a complete catalog. They accept streams and expose binary entry
content through `ArchiveContentProvider`; the API does not expose filesystems or
JSON mappers.

## Safety Policy

The default `CatalogArchivePolicy` enforces:

- 10 MiB compressed input/output
- 20 MiB expanded content
- 10,000 entries
- a maximum 100:1 expansion ratio

The reader rejects absolute and drive-qualified paths, traversal segments,
backslashes, NULs, duplicate normalized paths, symbolic links, and encrypted
entries. It spools bounded compressed input and expanded entries to temporary
storage so central-directory metadata can be checked without buffering the
complete archive in memory. The returned archive owns that storage and must be
closed.

Archive-safety and malformed-content failures are returned as stable findings.
Transient or local I/O failures remain `IOException`s and are not mislabeled as
invalid catalog content.

## Deterministic Output

The writer emits normalized forward-slash paths in sorted order with fixed
metadata, UTF-8 names, stable JSON property/map ordering, and stable
compression. Equivalent catalog content therefore produces identical ZIP
bytes. Catalog fingerprints are separate and are based on canonical catalog
content rather than ZIP layout.
